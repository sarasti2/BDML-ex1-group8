Include here a short paragraph (less than 70 words) explaining what you 
learned of the two chosen methods. The purpose is just to reflect on what
you did. 


We learned that it is possible to imputate missing values using two different methods: Mode (to categorical variables) and Linear Regression. The first method allows to replace the missing value using a central tendency measure. The predictive power of the latter allows to be more precise with the imputation and may not alter the results.
